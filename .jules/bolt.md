Date: 2026-05-16

Optimized blog index page with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) with 60 second revalidation period.## 2024-05-18 - ISR Caching Added
**Learning:** Adding Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to static Next.js App Router pages significantly improves Time To First Byte (TTFB) by caching the page output for 60 seconds.
**Action:** Always identify pages with static content that do not need real-time data but could benefit from caching. Use `export const revalidate = 60` for caching these pages.

## 2026-06-25 - Batch Server Components Data Fetching
**Learning:** Next.js Server Components and ISR pages can suffer from suboptimal Time To First Byte (TTFB) when using sequential await calls for independent data sources.
**Action:** Refactor independent await calls into a single Promise.all batch to fetch data concurrently.
