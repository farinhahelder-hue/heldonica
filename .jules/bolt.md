# Bolt - Blog Index Caching (ISR)

Date: 2026-05-16

Optimized blog index page with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) with 60 second revalidation period.## 2024-05-18 - ISR Caching Added
**Learning:** Adding Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to static Next.js App Router pages significantly improves Time To First Byte (TTFB) by caching the page output for 60 seconds.
**Action:** Always identify pages with static content that do not need real-time data but could benefit from caching. Use `export const revalidate = 60` for caching these pages.

## 2024-06-19 - Concurrent Data Fetching
**Learning:** Sequential await calls in Next.js Server Components unnecessarily block page rendering. Refactoring independent queries into a single Promise.all batch improves TTFB.
**Action:** Always identify independent data fetching calls in Server Components and batch them with Promise.all to fetch them concurrently.
